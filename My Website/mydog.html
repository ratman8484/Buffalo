                    This is a picture of my dog just chilling out with his favorite blanket. Sometimes when he is cold, I put a blanket on him
                    to warm him up. Usually this is when he just got a new haircut and he doesn't have his thick coat of fur on him. In this picture
                    he's also on a bench by the door since we sold some chairs that he used to sit on :( but eventually we will get him another 
                    more comfortable spot, and he ripped and destroyed his old bed sadly.

                    This is a picture of him sitting next to me in a car, he has his harness on, his whiskers are cute as hell, and he just looks so
                    happy to be driving with us. He is just the happiest and best looking dog that exists, he doesn't bark, he doesn't bite, he doesn't
                    destroy furniture, and is always the nicest guy on earth. I am truly lucky to have him

                    This is a pciture of him just chilling at my feet when I was laying down on the couch, he is sitting on a pillow that he in my opinon
                    is colder than the other spots in the house which may be why he is sitting on there. I remember that he ate a bully stick just
                    before taking this picture so he just looks so cute.
