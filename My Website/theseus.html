        <h3><b><u>What is the ship of theseus paradox?</u></b></h3>

        <p>
            The ship of theseus is a classic philisophical paradox that has stumped people<br>
            for thousands of years. The paradox goes as follows <br>
            <br>
            <hr style="margin-right: 500px;">
            <br>
            <b><u>1: The Original Ship:</b></u></b>
            <br><br>
            According to the ancient greek legend, the ship of the hero theeus was perserved<br>
            after a battle in a harbor as a historical monument.<br>
            <br><br>
            <u><b>2: The Replacement:</b></u>
            <br><br>
            To maintain the ship whenever a peice of wood rotted, a cloth was taken down or<br>
            damaged, the athenians would replace these parts with new parts<br>
            <br><br>
            <u><b>3: The Question:</b></u>
            <br><br>
            eventually, all the original parts were replaced. Then the paradox arose.<br>
            <i>If all the original parts of the ship of Theseus were replaced, is it still<br>
            the original ship?</i><br>
            <br><hr style="margin-right: 500px;"><br>
            <b><u>THOMAS HOBBES QUESTION</u></b>
            <br><br>
            So once you've answered the 3rd question, you'll still have another complication.<br>
            <i>What if the original parts of the ship that were taken off, were reassembled<br>
            into a second ship.</i><br>
            <br><br>
            The dillema here is that there have been 2 ships, one that was the original ship but
            slowly repaired, and the orther one of the thrown out parts of the original ship.
            <i>The question now becomes <b>"Which One Is The Original Ship?"</b></i>
            <br><hr style="margin-right: 500px;"><br>
        </p>

        <h3><b><u>The Many, <i>Many</i> Sides Of The Paradox.</u></b></h3>

        <p>
            They are both no longer the same ship.

            This stance is that they are no longer the same ship because of the one simple reason that
            they are each unique and differnet from the original. They have different parts
            they have gone through differnt things, and much more, the only thing they have
            in common is the name, and possibly the look.

            This is much like how you are not the you of yesterday, you have different experiences
            you know different things and have gone through and faced different challenges. If you
            go back in time, you can see you, have a conversation with you, and you guys may not
            agree with each other, even though you are "The Same person".

            I belive we as humans have a need to define things as something. <b>Thats an apple,
            thats a tree, and thats the ship of theseus.</b> But I belive this is a superfcial 
            concept amongst humans.
            

        </p>

        <p>
            The original ship is the same ship.

            This next stance is the belive that no matter how many parts have been replaced, it
            is still the original ship. It's the same situation with the human body, you replace
            dead cells everyday, you do not have any of your original cells from when you were 
            a fetus in your mothers woumb. 

            So what are you now no longer a you? If the "old you" killed somebody, are you not responsible for your actions, just because
            it was the you of yesterday who killed the guy? The answer is that you are the same you
            and the ship is the same ship.

            So, what if we took all the old parts and recreated the ship, would it be the
            original ship.
            No
            The parts do not define what is the ship, but it is the experiences of the ship, and
            what the <i>ship</i> not what the ship pyhsically is.
            What if you had a carbon copy of yourself infront of you. Are you no longer the you
            of today, do you not have your own thoughts and experiences. Just because PHYSICALLY
            it has the same cells and MENTALLY it has the same memories, does not change who you
            are.
